    Main branch – final branch once project is done and everything is working (no buggy codes, back-up container)​
    Feature branch – combine code for feature release​
    Dev branch – release branch for working and weekly reviews​
    Feature branches - individual writing code, documentation​
     **Documentation for every function**: if you write a function, comment on the parameters, what the function is doing​
       Give and example/provide specifics – this will work in specific cases, will not work in specific cases​
